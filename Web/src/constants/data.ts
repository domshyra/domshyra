		I’m a full stack software engineer who solves both technical and creative problems. 
		My work spans <b>React, .NET, Azure, SQL</b>, and <b>Terraform</b>, delivering web based SaaS applications 
		that are scalable, intuitive, and impactful. I’ve built tools for companies like <b>Tesla, SpaceX, Nike, Meta</b>, 
		and <b>Intel</b> at Currie & Brown, as well as modernized core systems at WSRB. I believe that design and development are both hard skills, and software should not only work — but work intuitively and tell a story.

		${workAboutSection}
		
		I believe great software tells a story — functional, elegant, and user-centered. I also strongly believe in good quality code top to bottom, like a carpenter making cabinets, it’s essential to have even the unseen screws be designed with consideration and intent. 
		
		I excel at transforming nebulous tasks into well-defined solutions through POCs and design documentation. I present these with clear pros and cons to drive technical direction and mentor the team on the new technologies or approaches being introduced. 
		${workHistoryInMy}
		I grew up in Portland, OR, and have since moved to Brooklyn, NY.
